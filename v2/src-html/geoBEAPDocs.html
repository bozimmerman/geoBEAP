INTRODUCTION
geoBEAP is a full featured archival program which supports numerous formats popular with GEOS and Commodore users.  These formats include .D64, .D71, .D81, .CVT (GEOS Convert), .BEP (geoBEAP disk image format), .LNX (LYNX, all versions, including geoPack files), .ARK, ZipCode, and both the single and multi-file compressed EMUTIL disk image formats (also called .RLE).

Some of the archive formats mentioned above are disk image formats.  This means that they are archives of every track and sector on a diskette.  The disk image formats are: .D64 (1541 disks only), .D71 (1571 disks only), .D81 (1581 disks only), .BEP (any GEOS/Wheels supported drives), ZipCode (1541 disks only), and the two types of EMUTIL formats (any GEOS/Wheels supported drives).

The remainder of the archive formats are file archive formats.  These formats support archives of selected source files, and include LYNX, ARK, and GEOS Convert.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
    geoBEAP requires the following hardware and software to execute:

 1. Commodore 64 or 128.
 2. GEOS 64 or 128, Wheels 64 or 128, gateWay 64 and 128, and MP3 64 or 128 (sorta... some operations will complete without problems, but then the app terminates abnomally. It's MP3s fault).
 3. At least one GEOS compatible drive. Two drives are required for disk image formats.
 4. The geoBEAP application.

USING GEOBEAP
    geoBEAP is executed by double-clicking on its icon. This will bring up the main selection screen. On the screen you will see two large file windows, one of which is for the source drive, which indicates the disk containing the files to be packed or the disk on which an archive file to be unpacked is found. The other is the destination file window, which will show files on the disk where an archive will be created or where an archive will be unpacked to.

    Running along the sides of the file windows are four arrow buttons for viewing different pages of file names. The up arrow will go back a page toward the beginning of the disk, while the down arrow will show files further down in the directory.  The farthest up arrow will show the first page of files, while the farthest down arrow will show the last page of files.

    Below each file window is a button for selecting which drive and disk is to be recognized as the source and destination. Clicking the drive button will cycle through your GEOS active drives from A to B to C to D and back to A. The disk button will prompt you to insert a new disk into the active drive for that file window.  Users of Wheels 64 or 128 can use the disk button to select a new partition or subdirectory.

    In the upper-middle part of the screen are selection boxes for choosing whether you wish to pack or unpack an archive.  A darkened square next to your selection will indicate which options are active. This may be changed by clicking in an unselected box.  Below there is a box to select the type of archive format.  The text that appears inside this box will designate the selected format.  Clicking on the box will change the format to the next available one.  Continue to click on this box to cycle through all supported archive formats.

    The selected archive format, and whether the pack or unpack box has been selected, will determine whether files in the source window can be selected.  While in the pack mode of a disk image format, no files may be selected.  While in the unpack mode of any archive format, or the pack mode of a file archive format, one or more files may be selected.  Up to 256 files may be selected for any purpose.

    The launch button will begin the packing or unpacking process as designated by your selections.

    At the top right of the screen is the exit box, which will exit back to the deskTop when clicked.

LAUNCHING

    When the launch button is clicked, the system will examine your selections on the main screen to determine if the process can begin.   What happens next depends on the selected format, and whether the pack or unpack box has been chosen.

.D64, .D71, and .D81 images

Packing:
    The .D64 format was first invented by the authors of the Commodore 64 emulator for the PC called C64S.  The .D71 and .D81 formats followed later.  Each is an uncompressed image of an entire disk, assuming the disk does not have any errors.  These format can be used to archive 1541 disks, 1571 disks, and 1581 disks only and respectively.

    To create one of these archives, first make sure that one of the supported disk drives is the source drive, that the source and destination drives are different, and that a disk capable of holding the entire disk image archive file is in the destination drive.  A 1541 disk image file (.D64) requires 689 free blocks on the destination disk.  A 1571 disk image file (.D71) requires 1378 free blocks on the destination disk.  A 1581 disk image file (.D81) requires 3200 free blocks on the destination disk.

    When clicking the launch button, the user will be asked to give a name (max 12 characters) for the archive file.  The extension .D64 or .D71 or .D81 will be automatically added to the name entered.  After confirming the process, a progress box located near the bottom of the destination file window will appear and update itself as the packing process completes.

    Remember that any disk errors on the source disk, such as those used as copy protection in some commercial programs, will abort the archival process.

Unpacking:
    To unpack one or more of these archives, select their names in the source file window.  Make sure that the destination disk is of the correct type (1541 for .D64, 1571 for .D71, and 1581 for .D81), and that the destination disk has been completely formatted.  Unarchiving a disk image onto an unformatted disk will abort the process.  Also remember that unpacking a disk image will completely erase any contents on the destination disk and replace them with the archive contents.

    If more than one image archive file has been selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each archive file.  When this confirmation box appears, the destination disk may be replaced in order to receive the next image archive.

geoBEAP (.BEP) images

Packing:
    The .BEP format was invented by the author of this program as a substitute for ZipCode and .D64 disk image formats.  The .BEP format features support for any GEOS supported disk or partition, and a much higher level of compression than that afforded by ZipCode or even the EMUTIL format.  Like the .D64 image archive, a .BEP archive file contains an entire disk image.  Unlike .D64 image archives, however, the .BEP format may be of a 1541 disk, a 1571 disk, a 1581 disk, a CMD FD2000 disk, a CMD HD partition, or a CMD RamLink partition.

    To create one of these archives, first make sure that the desired disk and partition are displayed in the source drive window, that the source and destination drives are different, and that a disk capable of holding the entire archive file is in the destination drive.    .BEP archive file sizes vary considerably.  A relatively blank 1571 disk may compress to only 3k (12 blocks), while a 1571 disk full of programs may not compress much at all (970 blocks).  Be sure to leave plenty of destination disk space for any possible archive.  Failure to do so will abort the archival process, once the disk becomes full.  Clicking the launch button will present the user with a dialog into which a name for the new .BEP archive file can be entered.  The extension .BEP will be automatically added to the name entered.  During the packing process, a progress box will appear in the destination window.

    The .BEP archive format uses a very complex algorithm in order to get very good compression of disks.  Because this algorithm is so complex, the creation of these archives can take a very long time.  A processor upgrade cartridge, such as the CMD SuperCPU, can improve the performance of this format considerably.

Unpacking:
    To unpack one or more of these archives, select their names in the source file window.  Make sure that the destination disk is of the correct type, which depends on the type of disk the .BEP file was made from.  geoBEAP will present an error if, for instance, it is asked to unpack a .BEP image of a 1571 disk onto a 1581 disk in the destination drive. The destination disk must also be completely formatted before unpacking can begin.  Unpacking a disk image onto an unformatted disk will abort the process.  Also remember that unpacking a disk image will completely erase any contents on the destination disk and replace them with the archive contents.

    If more than one image archive file has been selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each archive file.  When this confirmation box appears, the destination disk may be replaced in order to receive the next image archive.

    As mentioned above, the .BEP archive format uses a very complex algorithm in order to get very good compression of disks.  Because this algorithm is so complex, the unpacking of these archives can take a very long time.  A processor upgrade cartridge, such as the CMD SuperCPU, can improve performance considerably.

GEOS Convert (.CVT) files

Packing:
    The Convert program was first created by Berkely Softworks, the inventors of GEOS, as a means of converting GEOS-type files into standard sequential CBM type files.  Only in a sequential format can files be uploaded to the internet or BBSs.  GEOS files that have been Converted will usually end with the extension .CVT, though almost as often as not there will be no extension at all.

    Convert will only affect GEOS type files, such as geoWrite documents, GEOS applications, desk accessories, and so forth.  To convert, select the desired files in the source file window and click the launch button.  If the source and destination drives are the same, the conversion will be performed in-place.  In-place means that the GEOS file being converted will be replaced by the .CVT file.  If the source and destination drives are different, geoBEAP will copy the source file onto the destination disk before performing the in-place conversion.  This means that the destination disk must have enough space to hold the source files, and must not have files with duplicate names to either the source file, or the .CVT file being created.

    During the file Convert process, a progress box located near the bottom of the destination file window will appear and update itself as packing completes.  The extension .CVT will be automatically added to the names of the source files, and the source files will be given standard Commodore file names.

Unpacking:
    The unConverting process will turn a .CVT file back into a usable GEOS file.  To do this, select the .CVT files from the source file window and click the launch button.  If the source and destination drives are the same, the unpacking will be performed in-place, meaning the .CVT file will be replaced by the GEOS file contained therein.  If the source and destination drives are different, geoBEAP will copy the source archive file onto the destination disk before performing the in-place unpacking.  This means that the destination disk must have enough space to hold the source files, and must not have files with duplicate names to either the source .CVT file, or the GEOS file being created.


ZipCode (1!, 2!, etc..) images

Packing:
    ZipCode was written by A.L. Peters, and was both the first, and for a very long time the ONLY disk image archiver for Commodore computers.  Zipcode will create a multi-file disk image archive of a 1541 disk.  Although Zipcode supports a 4-pack format for standard 1541 disks, a 5-pack format for extended 1541 disks, and a 6-pack format for 1541 disks with errors, geoBEAP only supports the more common 4-pack version.  Each file in a 4-pack archive begins with a number from one to four, followed by an exclaimation point (1!diskname, 2!diskname, etc).  Zipcode will also use fast and effective compression.

    To create one of these archives, first make sure that the source drive is either a 1541 or 1571 disk drive, that the source drive contains a 1541 format disk, that the source and destination drives are different, and that a disk with at least a few hundred blocks free is available in the destination drive.  If the destination drive is filled up during the creation of the Zipcode 4-pack archive, a dialog box will be presented to allow a new destination disk to be inserted so that the process may be completed.

    When clicking the launch button, the user will be asked to give a name (max 14 characters) for the archive file.  The prefixes of a Zipcode archive (1!, 2!, 3!, and 4!) will be automatically added to the name entered.  After confirming the process, a progress box located near the bottom of the destination file window will appear and update itself as the packing process completes.

    Remember that any disk errors on the source disk, such as those used as copy protection in some commercial programs, will abort the archival process.

Unpacking:
    To unpack one or more of these archives, select the first file in each 4-pack (the one beginning with 1!) in the source file window.  Make sure that the destination drive is a 1541 or 1571 disk drive, and that the destination disk has been completely formatted.  Unarchiving a disk image onto an unformatted disk will abort the process.  Also remember that unpacking a disk image will completely erase any contents on the destination disk and replace them with the archive contents.

    If more than one 4-pack set has been selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each archive.  When this confirmation box appears, the destination disk may be replaced in order to receive the next image archive.

LYNX (.LNX) file archives

Packing:
    LYNX was originally written by Will Corely as a fast archival format for combining numerous Commodore files into a single archive file.  In addition to its speed, LYNX is also famous as one of the only file archive formats which supports Commodore REL (relative) type files.  Since the introduction of the original LYNX program, numerous other revisions and clones have appeared.  This includes the LYNX series, up through LYNX XV, Ultimate LYNX, Ultra-LYNX, and eventually geoPack.  geoBEAP supports them all, including (despite much pain and suffering), the Commodore REL (relative) type files.  GEOS users may be familiar with the "fact" that GEOS does not support relative files.  This may have been true before, but with geoBEAP, it supports them now.

    To create a LYNX archive, select the desired files in the source file window and click the launch button.  After entering a name for the new archive file (12 characters max), the packing process will begin.  The extension .LNX will be automatically added to the name entered.  If the source and destination drives are different, the first step will be to copy the sources files onto the destination drive.  This means that the destination disk must have space sufficient to hold all of the source files, and must not already have copies of the source files.  If the source and destination drives are the same, the archive will be created in-place.  This means that all of the source files will be removed from the source disk directory and replaced with the single LYNX archive.

    Before creating the LYNX archive, geoBEAP will attempt to Convert all GEOS type source files into .CVT format files.  Only in the .CVT format can GEOS files be placed into LYNX archives.  Finally, the source files will be placed into the LYNX archive.  If the source and destination drives were different, the archive will appear on the destination disk, and the source files will be unchanged on the source disk.  If the drives were the same, the source files will have been replaced by the LYNX archive.  During the creation of the LYNX archive, a progress box will appear in the destination file window.

    geoBEAP will create a LYNX XV compliant LYNX archive.

Unpacking:
    To unpack a LYNX archive, select the archive file from the source file window and click the launch button.  If the source and destination drives are the same, only one LYNX archive may be processed at a time, and the unpacking will occur in-place, which means that the LYNX archive file will be removed and replaced by the files which are the contents of the archive.  If the source and destination drives are different, any number of LYNX archives may be selected, and the archive files will be copied to the destination drive before they are unpacked.  This means that the destination disk must have sufficient space to hold the contents of the selected LYNX archives.

    During the unpacking process, a progress box in the destination file window will notify the user when files are being copied, unpacked from the LYNX archive, and Converted back from .CVT format to the GEOS file type format if necessary.  REL (relative) files will also require additional processing to restore side-sector links.  If more than one LYNX archive file was selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each archive file.

ARK (.ARK) file archives

Packing:
    ARK was originally written by Edward Rohr, and supports an archive format for combining numerous Commodore files into a single archive file.  ARK formatted archives are fairly rare, but are comparable in speed and functionality to LYNX archives.  Some believe that ARK was a more stable and reliable program than LYNX.

    To create an ARKive, select the desired files in the source file window and click the launch button.  After entering a name for the new ARKive file (12 characters max), the packing process will begin.  The extension .ARK will be automatically added to the name entered.  If the source and destination drives are different, the first step will be to copy the sources files onto the destination drive.  This means that the destination disk must have space sufficient to hold all of the source files, and must not already have copies of the source files.  If the source and destination drives are the same, the ARKive will be created in-place.  This means that all of the source files will be removed from the source disk directory and replaced with the single ARKive.

    Before creating the ARKive, geoBEAP will attempt to Convert all GEOS type source files into .CVT format files.  Only in the .CVT format can GEOS files be placed into ARKives.  Finally, the source files will be placed into the ARKive.  If the source and destination drives were different, the ARKive will appear on the destination disk, and the source files will be unchanged on the source disk.  If the drives were the same, the source files will have been replaced by the ARKive.  During the creation of the ARKive, a progress box will appear in the destination file window.

    geoBEAP will create a ARK V2 compliant ARKive.

Unpacking:
    To unpack an ARKive, select the ARKive file from the source file window and click the launch button.  If the source and destination drives are the same, only one ARKive may be processed at a time, and the unpacking will occur in-place, which means that the ARKive file will be removed and replaced by the files which are the contents of the ARKive.  If the source and destination drives are different, any number of ARKives may be selected, and the ARKive files will be copied to the destination drive before they are unpacked.  This means that the destination disk must have sufficient space to hold the contents of the selected ARKives.

    During the unpacking process, a progress box in the destination file window will notify the user when files are being copied, unpacked from the ARKive, and Converted back from .CVT format to the GEOS file type format if necessary.  REL (relative) files will also require additional processing to restore side-sector links.  If more than one ARKive file was selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each ARKive file.

EMUTIL single-file disk images

Packing:
    The EMUTIL format was invented by the author of this program as a disk image format for multiple computers and disk drives.  The original EMUTIL program runs on either a Commodore PET, or the C64, and is able to create a disk image archive file from any Commodore supported drive, including the old IEEE-488 drives, such as the CBM 8050 and CBM 8250.  This format features support for any GEOS supported disk or partition, and a level of compression comparable (and slightly better) than Zipcode.  Like the .D64 image archive, an EMUTIL archive file contains an entire disk image.  Unlike .D64 image archives, however, this format may be of a 1541 disk, a 1571 disk, a 1581 disk, a CMD FD2000 disk, a CMD HD partition, or a CMD RamLink partition.  Also worth mentioning is that, unlike the EMUTIL program, geoBEAP will place a special extension (.RLE) at the end of the EMUTIL archive files to better identify them.  EMUTIL does not place an extension on its archive files.

    To create one of these archives, first make sure that the desired disk and partition are displayed in the source drive window, that the source and destination drives are different, and that a disk capable of holding the entire archive file is in the destination drive.    EMUTIL archive file sizes vary considerably.  A relatively blank 1571 disk may compress to only 20k (80 blocks), while a 1571 disk full of programs may not compress much at all (1300 blocks).  Be sure to leave plenty of destination disk space for any possible archive.  Failure to do so will abort the archival process, once the disk becomes full.

    The EMUTIL .RLE format does not store any information about the original disk image format.  For this reason, embedding the type of disk from which the archive was made (1541, 1571, etc) into the name of the archive would be wise.

Unpacking:
    To unpack one or more of these archives, select their names in the source file window.  EMUTIL image files created with geoBEAP will have the .RLE extension.  EMUTIL image files created with EMUTIL may not.  Make sure that the destination disk is of the correct type, which depends on the type of disk the EMUTIL file was made from.  geoBEAP will not present an error if one of these archive files is unpacked onto the wrong type of disk, but will likely terminate prematurely. The destination disk must also be completely formatted before unpacking can begin.  Unpacking a disk image onto an unformatted disk will abort the process.  Also remember that unpacking a disk image will completely erase any contents on the destination disk and replace them with the archive contents.

    If more than one image archive file has been selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each archive file.  When this confirmation box appears, the destination disk may be replaced in order to receive the next image archive.



EMUTIL multi-file disk images

Packing:
    The multi-file EMUTIL format is identical to the EMUTIL single-file disk image format, except that the image is conveniently broken into numerous smaller files.  Each file in a multi-file EMUTIL disk image archive begins with a number from one on up, followed by a dash (1-diskname, 2-diskname, etc).  Multi-file EMUTIL disk image archives created with geoBEAP will also end with the .RLE extension.  Like the single-file version of this format, a compression algorithm comparable (read: better) than Zipcodes will be used on the disk sectors.

    To create one of these archives, first make sure that the desired disk and partition are displayed in the source drive window, that the source and destination drives are different, and that a disk with at least a few hundred blocks free is available in the destination drive.  If the destination drive is filled up during the creation of the EMUTIL multi-file archive, a dialog box will be presented to allow a new destination disk to be inserted so that the process may be completed.

    When clicking the launch button, the user will be asked to give a name (max 8 characters) for the archive file.  The prefixes of a EMUTIL multi-file archive (1-, 2-, 3-, .etc) and the .RLE extension will be automatically added to the name entered.  After confirming the process, a progress box located near the bottom of the destination file window will appear and update itself as the packing process completes.

    Remember that any disk errors on the source disk, such as those used as copy protection in some commercial programs, will abort the archival process.

Unpacking:
    EMUTIL multi-file disk image archives will always begin with a number and a dash, and those created with geoBEAP will end with .RLE.  To unpack one or more of these archives, select the first file in each multi-file archive pack (the one beginning with 1-) in the source file window.  Make sure that the destination drive is of the same type that the archive pack was created from, and that the destination disk has been completely formatted.  Unarchiving a disk image onto an unformatted disk will abort the process.  Also remember that unpacking a disk image will completely erase any contents on the destination disk and replace them with the archive contents.

    If more than one multi-file pack set has been selected, a confirmation dialog box will appear between each archive.  When this confirmation box appears, the destination disk may be replaced in order to receive the next image archive.
